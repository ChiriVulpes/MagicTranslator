## Please make issues before submitting pull requests.
Each pull should close an issue.

## Why does this project not have a license?
I have no idea which one to use. Something along the lines of MIT except with Commons Clause? I dunno. Just be respectful okay?
- DON'T steal the whole codebase to make your own version of the app or a similar app, especially for monetary gain.
- You MAY sell content created with the software.
- You MAY use pieces of the source code in your own projects, provided you leave credit in the source code (if open source) and in the UI of whatever you make itself (when bundled.)
